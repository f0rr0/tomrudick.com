            <p>Hi! I'm Tom. I currently live in Brooklyn, NY and help build data analytics tools for <a href="http:/www.spotify.com">Spotify</a>. I've been writing software for just over {{programming_age}} years and I still think it is lots of fun.</p>
            <p>I used to live in Seattle where I became an avid bow-tie enthusiast, coffee lover, and acquired a special penchant for strong mixed drinks. Brooklyn is great but I still miss Analog Coffee, Sun Liquor, and Five Point. I'll probably move back some day.</p>

            <p>Most people tell me that I am working on too many side projects but I'm just trying to have work/work balance. I've been most recently working on {{{link projects.most_recent.name projects.most_recent.url}}}.</p>
            <p>Last year, I <a href="http://rudickulous.com/post/38727951707/how-to-paint-a-mural">painted a mural</a> in Seattle with a whole bunch of strangers. It was probably one of the better projects that I've started.</p>
